            <p>The thing about the human brain is that, when you believe something,
                the brain will scan the environment for any signs that the belief is true</p>

            <p>This is thought bias.</p>

            <p>
                Thought bias is inevitable but we are not helpless to its effect.
                We naturally look for evidence that confirms our beliefs. <br/>
                then experience what we believe, even when there is
                evidence to suggest otherwise.
            </p>
            <p>
                Whatever has caused our low mood, it tends to come along
                with a focus on threat and loss (Gilbert, 1997).</p>

            <p>This bias towards the negative can then feed back to intensify
                the low mood if we continue to focus on and believe those
                thoughts to be facts.
            </p>
            <p>
                One strategy against the downward spiral this can cause is
                understanding that how we feel is not evidence that our
                thoughts are true.
            </p>
            <p>Another strategy is taking a stance of curiosity.</p>
            <p>
                Get some distance from those thoughts by becoming familiar
                with the common biases, noticing when they appear and
                labelling them as biases, not facts.

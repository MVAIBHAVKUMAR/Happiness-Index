            There is a misconception that self-acceptance will cause laziness,
            complacency and lack of drive.

            In reality the research shows us that those who develop self
            acceptance and learn to be self-compassionate are less likely to
            fear failure and more likely to try again when they do fail.
          </li>

            Self-acceptance is not the same as passively accepting defeat.

            is in your best interests.

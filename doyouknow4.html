            Learning the skills to deal with criticism and disapproval in a
            healthy way is a crucial life skill.

            We are built to care what others think of us, so telling ourselves
            that we don't care is not the answer.

            People-pleasing is more than just being nice to people. It is the
            persistent placing of others' wants or needs above your own, even to
            the detriment of your own health and wellbeing.

            Understanding why some people are highly critical helps. Nurturing
            your own self-worth and resilience to shame is both possible and
            potentially life-altering.

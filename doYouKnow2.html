            We have more influence over our emotional state than we were ever

            Pushing emotion away can cause more problems than allowing it to
            wash over us and take its natural course.

          <li>Emotions are not facts but are one possible perspective.</li>

            If there is painful emotion, get curious, ask questions. What can
            they tell you?
